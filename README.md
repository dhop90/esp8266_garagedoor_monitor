RPi Garage Monitor Device Type with Camera and Temperature Sensor

Combinded with an ESP8266 microcontroller, this divice driver is capable of monitoring and controlling a garage door, reporting temperature, humity and wifi signal strength as well as taking a video of garage door state.

Camera implementation was take from https://github.com/dmainmon/ArduCAM-mini-ESP8266-12E-Camera-Server

Copy the contents of libraries into the Arduino Libraries folder. On a windows computer this is usually "Documents/Arduino/Libraries"

Copy the GaragedoorCamTempSensor to the Arduino/Sketches directory.

scripts directory contains a build script to be able to compile from the command line.

```
./scripts/build: usages: hostname sketch [compile|push|network|serial|uploadonly]
compile: only compiles the sketch
   push: compiles and commits changes to repo
network: compiles and tries to upload sketch via network
 serial: compiles and tries to upload sketch via serial
uploadonly: does not compiles Sketch, just up load it by network or serial
```

// Garagedoor controler and
// ESP8266-12E ArduCAM Mini Camera Server
// with Temperature sensor

// This program demonstrates using an ArduCAM Mini 2MP camera with an ESP8266-12E module.
// An OV2640 2MP ArduCAM Mini was used with this program.
//
// The program has a web interface that will allow:
//  - storing and viewing of captured jpg files
//
// Captured jpeg files are stored on the ESP8266-12E built in memory.
//
// The capture and streaming features can be reached directly via the browser by using the format:
//    http://IPaddress/capture - for still capture
//
// The captured stills can be accessed as an HTML image:
//    <img src="http://IPaddress/capture">
